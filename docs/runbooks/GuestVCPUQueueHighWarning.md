# GuestVCPUQueueHighWarning

## Meaning

Within the most recent scrape window (120 seconds), a VirtualMachineInstance
(VMI) reported a **guest CPU run‑queue length of more than 10** runnable or
uninterruptible threads. The run‑queue length is derived from
`guest_load_1m – vCPU_count`.

## Impact

* Moderate CPU contention inside the guest. Latency may spike but workload still
progresses.

* An early signal that the VM might need additional vCPUs or that a short‑lived
process is causing bursts.

## Diagnosis

1. **Confirm queue length**
   ```promql
   kubevirt_vmi_guest_vcpu_queue{namespace="$NS",name="$VM"}
   ```

2. **Check host CPU usage**
   ```promql
   rate(kubevirt_vmi_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="$NS",name="$VM"}[2m])
   ```

3. **Inspect guest processes**
   `virtctl console <vm>` → `top -H` or `pidstat -u 1`

4. **Verify vCPU allocation**
   ```bash
   oc get vmi $VM -ojsonpath='{.spec.domain.cpu}'
   ```

## Mitigation

* **Immediately:** Consider live-migrating the VM to a node under a lighter load,
or throttle demanding processes.
* **Short term:** Hot-plug or increase vCPU limit; tune application thread pools.
* **Long term:** Implement horizontal scaling (HPA/KEDA, VMReplicaSet);
review placement rules.
