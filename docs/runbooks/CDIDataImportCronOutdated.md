# CDIDataImportCronOutdated

## Meaning

DataImportCron is in charge of recurring polling of latest version disk images as PVCs, commonly into a 'golden image' namespace;   
These are PVCs that always get updated with latest version,  
serving as a trustworthy clone source for created VMs (created from latest image of OS).  

This alert fires when a DataImportCron fails to create a corresponding PVC or keep its corresponding PVC updated (new `:latest` exists, we can't update to it).

**Note**:  
In the golden-image use case, `latest` is simply the latest OS version of the distribution.  
In the non-golden-image case, as described above, we are merely referring to the latest hash of the image that is available.

## Impact

VMs are created from outdated disk images *or* VMs fail to start because there is no source PVC to clone from.

## Diagnosis

### Distinguish between golden images and regular crons
DataImportCrons are widely used for golden images and likely serve as a source to create VM disks from, and thus it is vital for them to be up to date.
- Find the erronous DataImportCron's namespace & name:
	```bash
	kubectl get dataimportcron -A -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status.conditions[] | select(.type == "UpToDate" and .status == "False")) | .metadata.namespace + "/" + .metadata.name'
	```
	Output is returned as namespace/name - golden image crons will reside in the `openshift-virtualization-os-images` namespace.

- With golden image crons, verify a default storge class is configured:
	```bash
	kubectl get sc
	```
	A single storage class should be marked with `(default)` next to its name.

### Diagnosis artifacts
- Substitute `<cron_namespace>`, `<cron_name>` to find the DataImportCron's corresponding DataVolume (resides in same namespace as cron):
	```bash
	kubectl -n <cron_namespace> get dataimportcron <cron_name> -o json | jq .status.lastImportedPVC.name
	```
 
- Substitute `<dv_name>` with the above output to check for error messages:
    ```bash
	kubectl -n <cron_namespace> get dv <dv_name> -o yaml
	```

- Find cdi-operator's pod namespace:
	```bash
	export CDI_NAMESPACE="$(kubectl get deployment -A | grep cdi-operator | awk '{print $1}')"
	```
- Check cdi controller logs for error messages:
	```bash
	kubectl logs -n $CDI_NAMESPACE deployment/cdi-deployment
	```

- Follow the instructions in the 'Mitigation' section.

## Mitigation

A common issue when opting in to golden images auto-polling is not having a default storage class set.  
Ensure you have a default storage class set in the cluster *or*  
if you're using a custom DataImportCron, verify there is an explicit storage class set in the DataImportCron definition:
```bash
$ kubectl get dataimportcron cron-test -o yaml | grep -B 5 storageClassName
          url: docker://.../cdi-func-test-tinycore
      storage:
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
        storageClassName: rook-ceph-block
```

### Disconnected Environment

For a cluster installed in a restricted network, the default golden images cannot be pulled because they are out of reach, thus the alert will be fired.  
In that case, it is encouraged to disable the feature gate `enableCommonBootImageImport` to opt-out from automatic updates of the common data import cron templates and refrain from this alert being fired.  
This can be done by patching the HyperConverged CR:
```bash
$ kubectl patch hco kubevirt-hyperconverged -n $CDI_NAMESPACE --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/featureGates/enableCommonBootImageImport", "value": false}]'
```
More information about this feature gate can be found in [HCO cluster configuration documentation](https://github.com/kubevirt/hyperconverged-cluster-operator/blob/main/docs/cluster-configuration.md#enablecommonbootimageimport-feature-gate).


In other cases, please open an issue and attach the artifacts gathered in the Diagnosis section.
