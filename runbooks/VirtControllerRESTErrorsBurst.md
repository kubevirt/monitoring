# VirtControllerRESTErrorsBurst

## Meaning

For the last 10 minutes or longer, over 80% of the REST calls made to
`virt-controller` pods have failed.

The `virt-controller` has likely fully lost the connection to the API server.

This error is frequently caused by one of the following problems:

- The API server is overloaded, which causes timeouts. To verify if this is the
case, check the metrics of the API server, and view its response times and
overall calls.

- The `virt-controller` pod cannot reach the API server. This is commonly caused
by DNS issues on the node and networking connectivity issues.

## Impact

Status updates are not propagated and actions like migrations cannot take place.
However, running workloads are not impacted.

## Diagnosis

1. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:

   ```bash
   $ export NAMESPACE="$(kubectl get kubevirt -A -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
   ```

2. List the available `virt-controller` pods:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l=kubevirt.io=virt-controller
   ```

3. Check the `virt-controller` logs for error messages when connecting to the
API server:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl logs -n  $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
   ```

## Mitigation

If the `virt-controller` pod cannot connect to the API server, delete the pod to
force a restart:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -n $NAMESPACE <virt-controller>
```
