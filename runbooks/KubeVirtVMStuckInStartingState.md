# KubeVirtVMStuckInStartingState

## Meaning

The `KubeVirtVMStuckInStartingState` alert means that a VirtualMachine has been
in a starting state for more than 5 minutes. This alert can suggest an issue in
the VirtualMachine configuration, e.g., a misconfigured priority class or a
missing network device.

## Impact

There is no immediate impact. However, if there are multiple machines in a
starting state, it might indicate that something is not working as planned, for
example, a script may be consistently creating incorrect Virtual Machines
configurations.

## Diagnosis

Check the VirtualMachine's status and conditions, and VM logs and configuration
to find out what is causing the starting state.

```

## Mitigation

First, ensure that the VirtualMachine configuration is correct and all necessary
resources exist. For example, if a network device is missing, it should be
created.

If the state of the VirtualMachine is "Pending", it means that it wasn't
scheduled yet, which in turn rules out scheduling issues as the root cause. If
this is the case, possible causes include:

1. virt-launcher pod isn't scheduled
2. Topology hints for VMI aren't updated
3. DV is not provisioned/ready

This problem can be caused by several reasons. Therefore, we advise you to try
to identify and fix the root cause. If you cannot resolve this issue, please
open an issue and attach the artifacts gathered in the Diagnosis section.
