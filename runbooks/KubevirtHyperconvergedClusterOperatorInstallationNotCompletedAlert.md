# HCOInstallationIncomplete
<!-- Edited: apinnick@redhat.com, Aug 2022 -->

## Meaning
This alert fires when the HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO) runs for more
than an hour without a `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

This alert has the following causes:

- During the installation process, you installed the HCO but you did not create
the `HyperConverged` CR.
- During the uninstall process, you removed the `HyperConverged` CR before
uninstalling the HCO and the HCO is still running.

## Mitigation

Installation: Complete the installation by creating a `HyperConverged` CR with
its default values:

```bash
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
   name: hco-operatorgroup
   namespace: kubevirt-hyperconverged
spec: {}
EOF
```

Uninstall: Uninstall the HCO. If the uninstall process continues to run, you
must resolve that issue in order to cancel the alert.
