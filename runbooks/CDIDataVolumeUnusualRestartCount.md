# CDIDataVolumeUnusualRestartCount
<!-- Edited by apinnick, Nov 2022-->

## Meaning

This alert fires when a `DataVolume` object restarts more than three times.

## Impact

Data volumes are responsible for importing and creating a virtual machine disk on a persistent volume claim. If a data volume restarts more than three times, these operations are unlikely to succeed. You must diagnose and resolve the issue.

## Diagnosis

1. Find CDI pods with more than three restarts:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l app=containerized-data-importer -o=jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount>3)]}{.metadata.name}{"/"}{.metadata.namespace}{"\n"}'
   ```

2. Obtain the details of the pods:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl -n <namespace> describe pods <pod>
   ```

3. Check the pod logs for error messages:

   ```bash
   $ kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod>
   ```

## Mitigation

Delete the data volume, resolve the issue, and create a new data volume.
